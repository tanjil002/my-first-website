<p><b>Bangladesh</b> forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of <small>India</small> in 1947.[17] The country has a <em>Bengali Muslim majority</em>. Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms. Muslim conquests after 1204 heralded the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and a wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. After 1757Z</p>
<p>In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan. It was renamed as East Pakistan, with Dhaka becoming the country's legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952; the East Bengali legislative election, 1954; the 1958 Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat; the six point movement of 1966; and the 1970 Pakistani general election resulted in the rise of Bengali nationalism </p>
